This is the starting point for assignment one in CSCI 3310.

You will find a Makefile that does the minimum amount of work.  You
will probably want to expand on the Makefile, but keep the same file
name so we can use it when we are building your solution.

You will also find a mysh.c file.  The program does next to nothing,
except go into an infinite loop.  Feel free to change any of the
contents of this file.  You can use other files, but if you do
make sure that you update the Makefile

Remember to commit and push often.  This will make it easier for us
to help you.  If we have an up to date solution on GitHub, we
can build and run it ourselves.  There is no need to email program code 
and output to us.
