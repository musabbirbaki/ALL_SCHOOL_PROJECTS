This is the starting point for assignment two in CSCI 3310.

You will find a Makefile that does the minimum amount of work.  You
will probably want to expand on the Makefile, but keep the same file
name so we can use it when we are building your solution.

There are also client.c and server.c files to get your started.  Thses
files have most the includes and some of the variables that you need, but
there is no code.  You will also find copies of lib.h and lib.c that
we discussed in class.

Remember to commit and push often.  This will make it easier for us
to help you.  If we have an up to date solution on GitHub, we
can build and run it ourselves.  There is no need to email program code 
and output to us.
