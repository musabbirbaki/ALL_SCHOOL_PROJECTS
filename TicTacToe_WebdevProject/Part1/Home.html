<h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Basketball is a ball-based sport played worldwide in two competing teams of five.
     The objective of the game is to score more points than the opposing team. This is possible
     by defending your net from the opponent's shots and by scoring on theirs. To score,
     the ball must go through the net on the opponent's side of the court.
     The sport can be played indoors or outdoors with limited contact. The court itself
     is typically rectangular and made out of wood if played indoors. Officially, its dimensions are
     94 by 50 feet in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

     <br><br> The five official positions in the NBA include:
   </p>
     <ul>
       <li><b>Point Guard</b> (the "1"):    Tasked with organizing the offense and controlling the ball's location within the team.</li>
       <li><b>Shooting Guard</b> (the "2"): Tasked with taking the most shots and defending.</li>
       <li><b>Small Forward</b> (the "3"):  The most versatile position. It is interchangeable with the shooting guard. </li>
       <li><b>Power Forward</b> (the "4"):  Offensive player. Most versatile scorer and defends under the net.</li>
       <li><b>The Center</b> (the "5"):     Tasked to defend their team's basket and rebound.</li>
     </ul>

<h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
  <p>
    Basketball courts are found everywhere but what are the rules you might be wondering?
    <br><br>The rules differ depending on the league, but the general rules are as follows:

    <br><br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    In no particular order:
    <li>A successful shot is worth 2 points, unless shot from more than half the court in which it is 3.</li>
    <li>Contact is generally not permitted.</li>
    <li>Players must dribble the ball as he walks.</li>
    <li>Players cannot dribble with two different hands.</li>
    <li>The ball must stay within the court, the last team to touch the ball as it leaves lose possession of the ball.</li>
    <li>The ball cannot be kicked or hit with a fist.</li>
    <li>Players cannot interfere with a shot as it is falling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Basketball played outdoors unprofessionally (Streetball) can have a much different
    set of rules, it is worth discussing with the players prior. Just remember that
    the most important rule is to have fun fun fun!

<h2>History</h2>
  <p>Basketball was invented in December 1891 by James Naismith in Canada. Naismith was a
    physical education professor at the YMCA Training School. He created the game for his students
    with a peach basket nailed to a 3 metre elevated track. The balls used were
    of the soccer type and had to be retrieved manually as the basket was closed
    on the bottom.
    From here the sport we know and love began to form and changes followed.
    <br><br>The soccer ball tended to bounce unpredictably due to the laces,
    and after a couple iterations, today's ball was invented. <br><br>
    Retrieving the balls became tedious, so the bottom was removed, and eventually
    became a net with a rim.
