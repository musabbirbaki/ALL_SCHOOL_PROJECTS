  <p> Help me find fellow basketball enthusiasts</p>
  <p>
     I love basketball me and my boys play it every day religiously. I only wish the net was shorter
     and the opening bigger because its so hard to get the ball in. I also wish I was taller, but the website
     can't help me there can it? Nah it probably can't thats too bad but follow me on twitter. I am @basketballFan1
     and on youtube i make videos for the masses I wish we all can get together and just
     play a good game of ball we love to shoot hoops. I'm moving cities soon and I need new ball friends
     hit me up for some games if you're in the Philidephia area. - Julior Commentor

   Basketball is my sport. I think I'm going to go pro I'm just so good its crazy.
   I don't think I've ever lost a game and I play a handful a day. I might just start
   my own team, but at the same time I don't really need one I stay winning the 5 on 1s.
   Hopefully it gets difficult or something the sport is too easy. Great website I'm so glad it exists
   I go on here every day to read up about basketball because I am big basketball fan as you know.
